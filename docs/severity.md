# Severity Levels Expanded with Business Continuity Risks

## High
- Package poses an **immediate threat** to the project's functionality, legality, or continuity.
- Package is **officially deprecated or unmaintained**, with no viable alternative or migration path.
- Usage of the package risks **business-critical operations**, such as supply chain breakdowns or inability to meet contractual or regulatory obligations.

## Medium
- Package shows signs of becoming **unsupported** or has a **low update frequency**, introducing potential future risks but no immediate impact.
- Package has **unofficial or partial alternatives**, but migration would involve significant effort.
- **Business continuity risks** are possible but not critical yet.

## Low
- Package is **old but stable**, with minimal impact on business operations or projects.
- Package has **known successors**, and migration is straightforward but not yet required.
- Risks are **minimal** or can be mitigated with proactive measures.

## Informational
- Package is flagged for **awareness** (e.g., approaching end-of-life but still functional).

# Additional Risk Factors for Severity

### 1. Package Age and Maintenance
- **Too Old**: The package hasn't been updated for years, indicating possible abandonment.
- **Low Activity**: Few commits, pull requests, or issue resolutions in recent months/years.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Older packages may not support modern build systems, libraries, or languages.

### 2. Deprecation Status
- **Official Deprecation**: The package's maintainers have marked it deprecated and recommend alternatives.
- **Community Signals**: Users report abandoning the package due to critical bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **No Alternatives**: Deprecated with no clear replacement or migration path.

### 3. Business Continuity Risks
- **Critical Dependencies**: Package is a key dependency in business-critical systems.
- **Regulatory or Contractual Impact**: Inability to use or update the package would violate regulations or contracts.
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Risks to the continuity of package updates or fixes due to a single maintainer or lack of redundancy.

# Severity Matrix with Business Continuity Risks

| **Risk Factor**           | **High**                                      | **Medium**                                   | **Low**                                    | **Informational**                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Package Age**           | No updates >5 years, breaking changes in ecosystem | No updates 1â€“5 years, no ecosystem issues  | No updates but stable, minimal use        | Recently updated or legacy, no issues     |
| **Deprecation**           | Officially deprecated, no alternatives        | Deprecated with viable alternatives but costly | Deprecated with simple migration path    | Announced for deprecation but still maintained |
| **Business Criticality**  | Impacts critical systems, no alternative      | Potential impact, migration possible        | Low-criticality or easily replaceable     | Awareness of potential future risks       |
| **Maintenance Activity**  | Abandoned, maintainer unreachable             | Maintained sporadically, critical bugs unfixed | Maintained with minor activity           | Actively maintained                       |
| **Supply Chain Risks**    | Single maintainer, high probability of failure | Few maintainers, limited redundancy         | Maintainer risk mitigated, active community | Redundant maintainers, no supply chain risk |

# Defining High Severity in This Context

A package is **High Severity** if it meets one or more of the following criteria:

### Critical Business Continuity Impact
- Used in **business-critical systems** and lacks a viable replacement.
- **Regulatory or contractual implications** tied to its use.

### Officially Deprecated
- Deprecated **without migration guidance** or alternatives.
- Deprecation introduces **cascading failures** in dependent packages.

### Abandoned or Old
- **No updates** for a prolonged period, causing incompatibility with modern tools or frameworks.
- **High reliance** on the package for functionality with no contingency plan.

### Severe Supply Chain Risk
- Sole maintainer or minimal contributors, **no community support**.
- Package is part of a critical dependency chain but has **no redundancy**.

# Severity Annotation Examples

### High Severity
> **"High**: Package 'examplelib' (PURL: pkg:pypi/examplelib@1.2.3) has been deprecated by maintainers as of 2024-01-01, with no official replacement or migration path. The package is critical to production systems in frameworks dependent on Flask-3.0 and is not compatible with Python 3.12."

### Medium Severity
> **"Medium**: Package 'oldlib' (PURL: pkg:maven/oldlib@2.5.0) has not been updated since 2018. The package is stable and widely used, but future updates may require migration to 'newlib' (PURL: pkg:maven/newlib@3.0.0), which is API-compatible."

### Low Severity
> **"Low**: Package 'legacytool' (PURL: pkg:npm/legacytool@1.0.0) is marked for deprecation in 2026. Users are encouraged to evaluate alternatives, but immediate action is unnecessary."

### Informational
> **"Informational**: Package 'minorutil' (PURL: pkg:deb/minorutil@1.0.0) has seen reduced activity from maintainers but remains functional and has no known issues."
